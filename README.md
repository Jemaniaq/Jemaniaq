# My Projects
Here is a list with a short summary of my biggest projects. Most of the projects I made just to practice my coding skills
## IPv4Info
**IPv4Info** is a little UWP tool, which gives you information about a given IPv4 adress and subnet mask. 

Information could be:
- network adress length/subnet mask (dependend on which is given)
- status (public, private, reserved [for what?])
- network adress
- class
- ...

Another features:
- checks if a IP adress belongs to a subnet
- binary <-> decimal converter
- ...
